### Directional Fee

- A uniswap hook to adjust fee based on change in pool price at t and t-1 block.
- Original formula proposed by Nezlobin,

```
Î´=cÎ”, for some c>0.
```

Î´ represents change in fees, increase the fee for buys and lower the fee for sales Î´ for price change Î”.

With this implementation and simulation environment with limited dataset, we saw some improvements varying where fees collected by LPs were increased by 0.2 to 0.05% than normal pool.

The simulation in following [results](./sims/output.png)

- [Set 1](./sims/s3)
- [Set 2](./sims/s5)

However, we can iterate on the above idea and improve several aspects of it to make more profitable for LPs and fair for swappers.

- One such improvement can be the implementation of anti fragile fees, inspired by Anti Fragility coined by Nassim Taleb.

- Value of `c` can also be made dynamic but further research is required to determine which factors should be considered in determining a new value of `c` that will change the fees.
